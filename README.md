# Git Intellectual Bot (GIB)

## Project Description

Git Intellectual Bot (GIB) is an intelligent bot designed to manage user issues in Git repositories, streamlining the development workflow through automation.

You can try out the bot on this repo by making some issues!

## Key Features:

- **Issue Analysis**: GIB reads newly opened issues and asks clarifying questions to improve the quality and completeness of the report.
- **Automatic Labeling**: GIB analyzes the issue content and assigns relevant labels automatically to categorize the issues.

GIB leverages modern AI technologies, including large language models (LLMs), to improve efficiency and accuracy in issue handling. The bot is built with flexibility in mind, allowing integration with different LLM providers and Git hosting platforms. Currently, GIB supports GitHub and the OpenAI API.

This project is part of the capstone for the Ukrainian Summer Rustcamp 2024, showcasing the skills learned during the intensive bootcamp.
